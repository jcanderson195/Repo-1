There once was a boy named Tom. Tom lived in the United States. Tom does not know who to vote for for president. The only thing he knows is that Donald trump is a complete joke. He doesn't care about the citizens of the United States. He's a business man with no political experience and is only in this year's election for his own selfish gain. Tom feels that Donald Trump is racist against people of minority and doesn't care about their lives and the lives of their families. 

Tom has not paid attention to the other candidates and therefore doesn't know who to vote for.
